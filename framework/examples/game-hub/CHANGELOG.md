# Changelog

## v4.12.1 — 2026-02-19

### Match-3 Star Drop Persistence Fix

- **Star Drop state loss**: `restoreGame()` now hydrates last-mode board from `savedModes` instead of generating a fresh board. Drop tokens (`💰🌾⚡`) are correctly restored on re-entry.
- **DRY helper**: Added `restoreDropState(saved)` — shared by both `restoreGame()` and `startGame()` resume paths, eliminating the root asymmetry.
- **Saved-session badges**: Mode cards now show `▶ 120pts · 18 moves` when a saved session exists, informing players before they click.
- **CSS**: Added `has-save` styling for mode card description text (accent color + bold).

## v4.12.0 — 2026-02-19

### Server Modularization

Refactored monolithic `server.js` (1542 lines) into a modular composition root (~220 lines) with feature-specific route modules. Zero functional changes — all 184 tests passing.

- **`playerManager.js`** [NEW]: Extracted player state management, persistence (GCS + local fallback), schema migration, and graceful shutdown.
- **`data/questions.json`** [NEW]: Extracted hardcoded trivia question bank from server.js.
- **`routes/farm.js`** [NEW]: Farm endpoints (`/api/farm/*`, `/api/content/crops`).
- **`routes/resources.js`** [NEW]: Resource and Pet endpoints (`/api/resources/*`, `/api/pet/*`, `/api/farm/sell-crop`).
- **`routes/trivia.js`** [NEW]: Solo and Duel Trivia endpoints, room management, history.
- **`routes/match3.js`** [NEW]: Match-3 game endpoints (`/api/game/*`).
- **`routes/blox.js`** [NEW]: Building Blox endpoints (`/api/blox/*`).
- **`routes/leaderboard.js`** [NEW]: Match-3 and Blox leaderboard endpoints.
- **`server.js`** [MODIFIED]: Now a composition root — imports, configures, and mounts all route modules.

### Deployment Fix

- **Dockerfile**: Added `COPY playerManager.js`, `COPY routes/`, `COPY data/` — missing modules caused `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on Cloud Run.
- **`.dockerignore`**: Changed `data/` → `data/hub-db.json` — `data/questions.json` was being excluded from the Docker build context.

### Housekeeping

- `package.json` version bumped to `4.12.0`.
- Updated all README files with new project structure and test counts.

## v4.11.1 — 2026-02-19

### Bug Fixes

- **Farm harvest stuck** (Bug 1): Crops couldn't be harvested immediately after growth completed. Root cause: harvest guard required stale server-side `plot.growth` (refreshed only every 30s) AND `startLocalGrowthTick` stopped rendering entirely when all crops finished. Fix: trust local clock-corrected growth (server validates on harvest API); do one final render on the growing→done transition.
- **Blox leaderboard 500** (Bug 2): `/api/blox/leaderboard` crashed when iterating players whose DB records pre-dated the Blox feature (`p.blox` undefined). Fix: optional chaining `p.blox?.highScore`.
- **Match-3 cross-device desync** (Bug 3): Server stored only one `currentGame` — multi-mode sessions (Classic/Timed/Drop) existed only in device-local `localStorage` and couldn't cross devices. Fix: added `savedModes` field to server player record, new `/api/game/sync-modes` endpoint, `persistSavedModes()` syncs to server, `restoreGame()` merges server modes.

## v4.11.0 — 2026-02-19

### UX/UI Audit — Phase 3 (Cognitive Load Reduction)

- **Farm shop FAB** (7.1): Floating 🛒 button on farm screen opens shop tab directly.
- **Match-3 recommended badge** (7.2): "⭐ Recommended" badge on Classic mode for first 3 games, auto-hides after.
- **Trivia settings panel** (7.3): ⚙️ Settings toggle exposes category and difficulty selectors. Defaults: All/Medium.
- **Farm growth time estimate** (7.4): "~45s left" / "~2m left" label below growth bar on each plot.
- **Energy tutorial tooltip** (7.6): One-time tooltip on energy pill explaining how energy works. Auto-dismisses after 10s.
- **Economy guide overlay** (7.7): `?` button in TopHUD opens a flow diagram showing the full economy loop.

### Housekeeping

- Cache-busting: CSS `?v=4.9` → `?v=4.11` in `index.html`.
- `package.json` version bumped to `4.11.0`.

## v4.10.0 — 2026-02-19

### UX/UI Audit — Phase 2 (Accessibility + Consistency)

- **Gold color brightened** (5.2): `--gold` changed from `#fbbf24` → `#f5cf50` for better contrast on dark glass panels (~5.5:1 ratio on `#1e1b2e` surfaces).
- **Button style convention** (6.5): `btn-danger` (red gradient) and `btn-success` (green gradient) standardized in `base.css`. Convention established: primary=purple, success/confirm=green, danger=red. Duplicate `btn-danger` removed from `blox.css`.

> **Note:** Items 5.1, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4 were already implemented in Phase 1 (v4.9).

## v4.9.1 — 2026-02-19

### Bug Fixes

- **Screen headers hidden**: Removed per-game `<h2>` headers (`display: none`) — nav bar already provides game labels. Reclaims ~70px of vertical space, fixing Blox piece tray being clipped behind the nav bar and farm plots being partially obscured.
- **Match-3 cross-device desync**: `restoreGame()` now treats server state as authoritative — clears localStorage `savedModes` entirely and replaces with only the server's active session. Prevents stale sessions from device A appearing on device B.

## v4.9.0 — 2026-02-19

### UX/UI Audit — Phase 1 (Navigation, Visual Polish, Feedback)

#### Navigation Overhaul

- **Universal bottom nav bar**: Now visible on ALL devices (was mobile-only). Desktop nav dots removed — single navigation paradigm everywhere.
- **Auto-hide during gameplay**: Nav bar slides away during active Blox/Match-3 sessions via `.nav-hidden` class, recoverable on game-over/pause. `navBarAutoHide(hide)` helper in `shared.js`.
- **Periodic arrow flash** (desktop): Nav arrows flash subtly every 90 seconds to remind pointer users of swipe navigation.
- **Swipe hint re-show**: Swipe hint now re-shows after 3 days (was fire-once). Uses timestamp (`hub_swipe_hint_ts`) instead of boolean flag.

#### Visual Polish

- **Warm pastel overlay accents**: Game-over (gold `#f5cf50`), energy confirm (green `#a8d8a8`), pause (lavender `#c4b5e0`) overlays now have colored top borders for visual typing.
- **Toast tinted backgrounds**: Success/error/info toasts get subtle background tints matching their border color + leading emoji icons (✅/❌/ℹ️).
- **Stats bar labels**: Bumped from `0.6rem` → `0.72rem` with emoji icon prefixes (🏆, 🪙, ⭐, 🔥, 📊, 🏅) for scan-ability.
- **Blox ghost cell**: Dashed border + lower opacity (`0.45`) for better valid/occupied distinction.
- **Match-3 mode card lift**: Active mode card lifts `translateY(-2px)` with deeper shadow for clear selection state.
- **Crop emoji enlarged**: `2rem` → `2.3rem` for better readability on farm plots.

#### Touch & Interaction

- **Buy-bar stepper buttons**: `26×26px` → `38×38px` for reliable mobile tapping (item 3.3).
- **Seed card min-height**: 88px floor prevents cramped touch targets on small seed cards.
- **Farm inventory buttons**: Mobile min-height `36px` → `44px` for Apple HIG compliance.
- **Base button padding**: `11px` → `13px` for all `.btn` elements.

#### Consistency & Layout

- **Card/stats-bar widths**: Standardized from `min(520px, calc(100vw-80px))` → `min(480px, calc(100vw-60px))` across all game screens.
- **Overlay z-index**: Bumped from `200` → `250` to layer above nav bar correctly.
- **Inline styles → utility classes**: Game-over overlays replaced inline font/color with `.overlay-score` and `.overlay-detail` classes.
- **Farm tab warm fill**: Active farm panel tab background bumped to `0.1` opacity with `0.78rem` font.
- **Text contrast**: `--text-dim` brightened from `#94a3b8` → `#a3b1c6` for fine-print readability.

#### Feedback & Animations

- **Plant bounce** (`plantBounce`): Subtle scale pulse on harvest (wired via `.plant-bounce` class).
- **Screen shake** (`screenShake`): Dramatic shake for Blox game-over (wired via `.screen-shake` class).
- **Farm tab gold pulse**: Nav tab gets `navTabFarmPulse` animation + badge pulse when crops are ready (`.farm-ready` class on nav tab).

### Version Bump

- All CSS/JS/HTML version query strings → `v4.9`. File headers bumped in `base.css`, `farm.css`, `match3.css`, `blox.css`, `shared.js`.

## v4.8.1 — 2026-02-19

### Bug Fixes

- **Blox leaderboard alignment**: Leaderboard panel was shifted too far left and pushed the game board off-center. `blox-lb-panel` is now `position: absolute; right: calc(50% + 220px)` — floats to the left of the centered board without affecting layout flow. Game area is always centered on the player's screen.
- **Blox board centering**: Removed `gap` and `align-items` from `.blox-main` flex container so the board+tray column is the sole flex child driving centering.

### Version Bump

- `blox.css` header → `v4.8.1`.

## v4.8.0 — 2026-02-19

### Bug Fixes

- **Energy pill regen bar clipping**: Added `overflow: hidden` to `.hud-energy` so the aurora fill bar stays within the pill's rounded boundary at all widths (previously overflowed at 1-5%).

### Match-3 UX Overhaul

- **Mode persistence**: The last-played mode is always pre-highlighted in the mode selector bar. Players no longer see "no mode selected" on screen re-entry or after game-over.
- **Auto-start on piece interaction**: Touching/clicking the board when no game is active auto-triggers the energy confirmation for the pre-selected mode — no need to manually click a mode card first.
- **Energy confirmation dialog**: New `confirmAndStart()` shows "Spend 5⚡ to play Classic?" before deducting energy. Saved sessions resume for free (no confirmation). Replaces the old silent energy deduction on mode card click.
- **Simplified game-over overlay**: Removed "Play Again" button. Shows score, best score, and "🎉 New Record!" congrats when applicable. Single "✅ OK" dismiss returns the player to the board with the mode bar visible.
- **Mode card routing**: Clicking a mode card when no game is active routes through `confirmAndStart()`. During an active game, it switches modes directly.

### Version Bump

- All file headers, `package.json` → `v4.8.0`.

## v4.7.0 — 2026-02-19

### Bug Fixes

- **Blox premature game-over**: `clearLines()` now clears `board[][]` synchronously; the 300ms `setTimeout` only handles the visual `.clearing` CSS animation. The game-over check (`canAnyPieceFit()`) is deferred until after the animation completes, ensuring it runs against the correct board state.
- **Match-3 API race condition**: Removed the duplicate fire-and-forget `/api/game/move` call inside the game-over branch of `attemptSwap()`. This call raced with `/api/game/end`, causing 400 "no active game" errors on the server.

### Tests

- 4 new game-over correctness tests in `blox.test.js` — verifies synchronous line clearing and correct `canAnyPieceFit()` behaviour after clears.

### Version Bump

- All file headers, `package.json` → `v4.7.0`.

## v4.6.0 — 2026-02-18

### Bug Fixes

- **Play Again button not working**: `showModeSelector()` now dismisses the game-over overlay (`#m3-overlay`) and pause overlay before showing mode selection. Previously the game-over overlay stayed on top, blocking all interaction. Also resets `gameActive`, `gamePaused`, and `swipeBlocked` for clean state.

### Global Version Constant

- **Single source of truth**: Server reads `package.json` version at startup, injects `window.__APP_VERSION__` into HTML via `<!--APP_VERSION_INJECT-->` placeholder.
- **SmartLoader auto-sync**: `shared.js` SmartLoader reads `window.__APP_VERSION__` for cache-bust — no more hardcoded version strings.
- **Version badge auto-sync**: `{{APP_VERSION}}` placeholder in badge div, replaced by server.
- **Eliminates manual updates**: Only `package.json` and file headers need manual version bumps on release.

### Star Drop Visual Enhancement

- **Unique colors**: Drop gems now use radial gradients with hues that don't overlap any of the 6 regular gem types:
  - 💰 Gold Bag: rose-gold metallic (`#ffe4c4 → #e6a654 → #c4803d`)
  - 🌾 Seed Pack: deep emerald (`#b4ffd0 → #10b981 → #047857`)
  - ⚡ Energy: electric violet (`#e0c3fc → #a855f7 → #7c3aed`)
- **Unique borders**: Thick white border (3px, 85% opacity) + animated `dropBorderPulse` glow with per-type `--drop-color` custom property. Glow expands outward in sync with existing `dropGlow` pulse.
- **3D inner glow**: Radial gradient placed at 35% 35% creates a gem-like highlight that no regular flat-gradient tile has.

### Version Bump

- All file headers, `package.json` → `v4.6.0`.

## v4.5.3 — 2026-02-18

### Match-3 Mode Selector Fix (Critical)

- **Mode selector always accessible**: `init()` eagerly creates the mode selector so it exists for `hideModeSelector()`. After "Continue", mode switcher bar appears inline — player can always switch modes.
- **`onEnter()` state handling**: Properly distinguishes active game → pause overlay, saved sessions → continue overlay, no sessions → mode selector directly. Previously showed pause overlay in all cases.
- **"New Game" / "Play Again" → mode selector**: Both `m3-btn-start` and `btn-m3-play-again` now open the mode selector instead of calling `startGame()` directly.
- **`showModeSelector` exported**: Available to external callers (`shared.js` wiring).

### UX Button Hierarchy

- **Continue is primary**: When saved sessions exist, "▶ Continue" is `btn-primary` (first, most prominent), "🎮 New Game" is `btn-secondary`, "🛑 End All Sessions" is `btn-muted` (small, transparent, least prominent).
- **DOM reordering**: Buttons dynamically reordered each time the pause overlay opens to ensure correct visual hierarchy regardless of initial HTML order.
- **Handler reset**: All button `onclick` handlers reset on each overlay open to prevent leaking handlers from prior overlay states.
- **`.btn-muted` CSS class**: New button style — transparent, dim, small text — for destructive-but-rare actions.
- **`.overlay-actions`**: Flex column layout for consistent vertical button stacking.

### Version Bump

- All file headers, cache-bust strings, package.json → `v4.5.3`.

## v4.5.2 — 2026-02-18

### Stale Cache Fix (Critical)

- **Cache-bust audit**: All `?v=4.1` strings in `index.html` (7 CSS + 4 JS) and `shared.js` SmartLoader updated to `?v=4.5.2`. Server content-hash injection still runs at runtime, but source now matches.
- **SmartLoader**: Dynamically created `<script>` tags now use `?v=4.5.2` instead of stale `?v=4.1`.

### Test Script Fix (Critical)

- **`npm test` now runs all 167 tests**: Added `blox.test.js` (26), `match3.test.js` (12), `ux.test.js` (29), `gcp.test.js` (20) to `package.json` test script. Previously only 80 of 167 tests ran.

### Header Audit

- **All file headers aligned to `v4.5.2`**: `shared.js`, `store.js`, `hud.js`, `pet.js`, `farm.js`, `trivia.js`, `blox.js`, `match3.js`, `match3.css`, `blox.css`, `blox.test.js`.
- **Version badge**: `index.html` badge updated to `v4.5.2`.

### Docs

- **README**: Fixed Demo Showcase `3-in-1 Hub` → `4-in-1 Hub`.

## v4.5.1 — 2026-02-18

### Match-3 Session Persistence (Critical)

- **Save on creation**: New games stashed into `savedModes` immediately after board generation — game state now survives page reload even without making any moves.
- **Persist after every swap**: `savedModes` updated and written to `localStorage` after each successful gem swap — mid-game progress never lost.
- **Zero-move boards saved**: Removed `score > 0` gate — boards with no moves made are preserved when switching modes (no energy re-charge).
- **Resume overlay**: When saved sessions exist after reload, pause overlay shows "▶ Continue" + "🛑 End All Sessions" + "🎮 New Game" instead of just "New Game".
- **Auto-classic start**: If no saved sessions exist on first launch, classic mode starts automatically (no manual mode selection needed).

## v4.5 — 2026-02-18

### Match-3 Mode Selector UX

- **Mode selector always accessible**: Shown directly on init and onEnter — no more invisible "New Game" gate required to browse modes
- **Energy denial → mode selector**: When energy check fails, user returns to mode selector instead of being trapped with stale `gameMode`
- Header bumped to v4.5

### Farm UX

- **Click-to-water**: Tapping a growing, unwatered plant now triggers watering instead of showing "Still growing" toast — eliminates frustration with small water button
- Updated toast: "💧 Already watered! Growing…" for already-watered plants

### Notification Badge Fix (Critical)

- **Wrong screen index**: `updateFarmBadge()` used hardcoded screen `1` (Blox) instead of `2` (Farm) — clicking the badge navigated to Blox instead of Farm
- **Direction arrows**: Fixed `point-left`/`point-right` logic for 4-screen layout
- Farm module bumped from v3.3 → v4.5

### Toast System

- **Deduplication**: Same message within 1.5s is suppressed (prevents toast stacking from rapid actions)
- **Color variants**: `showToast(msg, "success"|"error"|"info")` for context-appropriate left-border colors
- Duration extended 2.1s → 2.5s

### Stale Cache Fix

- **In-game version badge**: Fixed stale `v4.1` → `v4.5` in `index.html`

## v4.4 — 2026-02-17

### Match-3 Critical Fixes

- **Energy Guard Fix**: Energy check now runs _before_ `gameMode` mutation. Previously, failing the energy check left `gameMode` corrupted, causing board state to copy across modes. `match3.js`.
- **State Persistence**: `savedModes` now persisted to `localStorage` (`m3_saved_modes`). Game states for each mode survive page reload — no more lost progress. `match3.js`.
- **Restore Continuity**: `restoreGame()` now populates `savedModes` from server data, so "Continue" works correctly on first entry after reload. `match3.js`.

### Blox Mobile Fixes

- **Touch Drag Freeze**: Removed `renderTray()` call during `touchstart` — it was destroying the DOM touch target mid-event, causing browsers to cancel the touch sequence. Now uses CSS `.dragging` class for visual feedback. `blox.js`, `blox.css`.
- **Ghost Alignment**: Ghost preview now aligned with the lifted drag preview by offsetting `getBoardTarget()` coordinates by `liftY`. `blox.js`.
- **Lift Reduced 15%**: Touch lift factor reduced from 2.5× to 2.125× cell size for better finger proximity. `blox.js`.

## v4.3.1 — 2026-02-17

### Hotfix

- **Blox Startup Crash**: Fixed `SyntaxError: Identifier 'dragPreviewEl' has already been declared` caused by duplicate variable declaration in v4.3. `blox.js`.

## v4.3 — 2026-02-17

### Critical Fixes

- **Match-3 Star Drop Deadlock**: Added `hasValidMoves()` check after board generation and star placement. If no moves are possible, the board is regenerated until playable. `match3.js`.
- **Match-3 State Persistence**: Switching modes (Classic/Timed/Drop) now saves the previous game state (board/score/timer). Returning resumes where you left off without consuming energy. `match3.js`.
- **Match-3 Timer Fix**: Fixed "Time Attack" timer bleeding into other modes. Timer is now properly cleared on mode switch. `match3.js`.
- **Blox Mobile Drag**: Drag preview now scaled to **1:1 board size** (was mini) and offset above finger for better visibility. `blox.js`.
- **Touch Stability**: Added `touch-action: none` to full gameplay containers to prevent browser scrolling interference. `blox.css`, `match3.css`.

## v4.2 — 2026-02-17

### Improvements

- **Blox PC Drag**: Added mouse drag-and-drop (click-hold). `blox.js`.
- **Blox Stability**: Fixed mobile touch piece-stuck issue. `blox.js`.
- **Match-3 Pause**: Added pause/continue overlay to match Blox UX. `match3.js`.
- **Match-3 Swipe**: Added touch/mouse swipe gesture for gem swapping. `match3.js`.
- **Star Drop Logic**: Bonus items now preserved during gravity/cascades. `match3.js`.

## v4.1 — 2026-02-17

### UX Overhaul

- **Mobile Bottom Nav Bar**: 60px tab bar (emoji+labels), touch devices only. `base.css`, `shared.js`, `index.html`.
- **Blox Persistence**: `localStorage` save/restore board+tray+score. `blox.js`.
- **Blox Pause Overlay**: Frosted-glass overlay (New/Continue/End). Replaces old start button. `blox.css`, `index.html`.
- **Blox Ghost Fix**: Board-level `mousemove` + `click` with center-of-mass offset. No per-cell gap flicker, placement matches ghost exactly. `blox.js`.
- **Blox Touch Drag**: Tray→board drag with floating preview + `HUB.swipeBlocked`. `blox.js`, `blox.css`.
- **Match-3 Sidebar**: Vertical mode selector left of board on desktop >680px. `match3.css`.
- **Match-3 Mode Switch**: Non-active modes clickable during play (toast, no `confirm()`). `match3.js`.
- **Match-3 Descriptions**: 0.68rem, readable text. Star Drop moves 20→30. `match3.js`, `match3.css`.
- **Farm Mobile Buttons**: Sell/Feed enlarged (8px×14px, 0.82rem, 36px min-height) at <640px. `farm.css`.

### Bugfixes (same day)

- `confirm()` blocked by Discord sandbox — replaced with toast+direct switch.
- Ghost/placement offset mismatch — unified `getTargetFromEvent()` for both.
